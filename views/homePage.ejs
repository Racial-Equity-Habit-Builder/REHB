          Hi, I'm Ashley Biermann. I'm a full-stack JavaScript engineer with a background in music education and the arts. Throughout my personal and professional endeavors, I have always found great satisfaction when technologies not only meet my expectations, but surprise me with a uniquely positive experience. This has inspired me to create high quality moments for others, especially when I see them struggle with a technology that is inadequate or poorly built. By growing my skills and knowledge in software development, I knew I could become a part of the solution. I am seeking to earn a position with a company that shares my passion to create intuitive user experiences.

          Hi, I’m Dave Wolfe. I’m a Full stack JavaScript Developer. I started playing D&D in my early teens, which led to my love of working with teams to creatively solve problems. Whether it was owning my own business, organizing and running large events, sales and customer service, or QA for mobile and desktop applications, working with a team to solve the issues at hand is what I enjoy the most. So, I’m looking for a position as a software developer where I can work with a dynamic team to develop quality software.

          My name is David Palagashvili and I have a vision to make the world a better place for small business owners.
          In early 2018, I was eager for more than just a middle management position at a prominent security company. While maintaining a full-time leadership role, I self-funded and self-started my own small business selling niche contractor goods. Today, I'm proud to say that entering its third year in business, Omnigrit Tool Co is officially profitable!
          But those few years were far from a walk in the park, along the way I hit many hurdles centered around the confusing UIs of eCommerce platforms and the general overwhelming and ambiguous  processes of starting a business outside of the organizational domain. I found myself often thinking, "what if they could just make it a step-by-step process... a seamless process where I just need to know my product and they handle the rest?" ... then I came across Code Fellows at an event.
          6 months ago, I didn't even know what a boolean was... today I'm a full-stack Javascript Developer and I have my eyes to the future!
          I envision an Amazon Locker replacing every department store in America.
          I envision an Amazon Seller Central that allows people to flourish the passions that made them start their business, takes care of the systemic headaches involved in starting up a business and keeping it running.
          If I could contribute to this vision in any way, it would be a singular honor!

          I am a Full Stack Software Engineer and Team Mate Extraordinaire! I have thrived in a team based atmosphere for my entire life.

          I chose to dive into the Software Industry after starting a company whose goal was to connect attorneys to legal professionals so that tasks could be accomplished on the task by task basis. Given how successful other startups in the gig economy have done with these business models, my concept was picked up by a local tech incubator, and I took the idea all the way to starting our MVP. However, in order to accomplish this, I had to raise $350,000. Thus, an opportunity to learn a new skill and grow as a person was born! I am open to opportunities that take me near or far, and believe that there is no opportunity that I don’t have the ability to thrive in!

          Hello, My name is Paul Depew, I am a full-stack Javascript developer and UX/UI designer looking to build scalable, human-oriented systems from first touch to end result. As a lover of poetry I came upon the phrase, “How can a man be measured if he is never put beyond his depth?” This has pushed me to manage projects and work that were larger than I ever felt capable of handling, yet also inspired me to rise to the opportunity. During my career, I have always gravitated to projects with social meaning and community importance. This had led me to work with arts groups, nonprofits, start-ups and well established companies doing everything from building and standardizing systems to ensuring smooth operations and growth. 
          I am looking to find an organization that can utilize these creative tendencies and get it done attitude to make cool stuff and tell awesome stories
